################ GOLD PREDICTOR ACTIVITY ################

Instructions:
- Ask the user to enter the mass of a metal object.
- If the mass is between 35g and 60g (inclusive), it's GOLD!
- If it's less than 35g, it's too small to be gold.
- If it's more than 60g, it's too big to be gold.
- Use an f-string to show the exact mass in your output.

Example:
Input: 45
Output: We found Gold with a mass of 45g, boss!

#return vs print
'''
# Difference between print() and return

- print():  
  * Shows the result on the screen immediately.  
  * Used to display output to the user.  
  * Does NOT send the result back for further use.

- return:  
  * Sends the result back to where the function was called.  
  * Allows you to save or reuse the result later in your program.  
  * Does NOT automatically display anything unless you print it.

'''
common types of exceptions are:

ZeroDivisionError: Raised when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero.
TypeError: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.
ValueError: Raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right
type but an inappropriate value.
IndexError: Raised when a sequence subscript is out of range.
KeyError: Raised when a dictionary key is not found.
FileNotFoundError: Raised when a file or directory is requested but doesnâ€™t exist.
IOError: Raised when an I/O operation (such as a print statement, the built-in open() function or
a method of a file object) fails for an I/O-related reason.
ImportError: Raised when an import statement fails to find the module definition or when a from
... import fails to find a name that is to be imported.
MemoryError: Raised when an operation runs out of memory.
OverflowError: Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be expressed by
the normal number format.
AttributeError: Raised when an attribute reference or assignment fails.
SyntaxError: Raised when the parser encounters a syntax error.
IndentationError: Raised when there is incorrect indentation.
NameError: Raised when a local or global name is not found
